 The project is about a cargo tracking system which is a desktop application.
 <br><br>
The project is a desktop application. In this desktop application you have to sign in.If you have no account you need to sign up. All information is saved in the firebase
  real-time database. After signin in the home page opens. If the user is a customer, can select or add delivery point on map. If the user is a courier, can show the shortest 
  route between all points on map. I used Dijikstra Algorithm for finding the shortest route. If you add or delete a point while the program is running, my database can update 
  itself. And you can show courier's moving 
  
  The project has 4 important features;
     
  1) Communication with Google Cloud API
  2) The Shortest Route Algorithm (Dijikstra)
  3) After Changing Points or Others, Updating the Program Itself
  4) Design and Clean Code

 Some informations about Google Maps have deleted for security reasons. You can add your informations to run the code
